# cpp-tic-tac-toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ for the console. The game supports two-player mode, allowing players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
