# Tic-Tac-Toe (C++ Console Game)

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++ in the console. It allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Clean console-based interface
- Simple and efficient gameplay logic

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to input their moves by selecting a position on the grid (1-9).
3. The first player to align three of their marks (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
